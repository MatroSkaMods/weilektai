### The Great Extinction

An instantaneous solar flare synced at the north pole of every single star in the galaxy, creating a force so powerful that it turned the entire galaxy into a shkadov thruster for a brief moment. 

The intense solar flares wiped out life on every planet close to a star.

Research on the cause is currently being conducted at [Nelewei](../../Technology/nelewei.md).

Cause:
A Weian Scientist tried to create a quantum tunnel between every solar system in the galaxy to aid in transport. Will elaborate further soon.
