##### A conversation between Skahdi and Artax
##### Re: Society
```
Artax:
What kind of culture and hierarchy do they have!

Skahdi:
Ah yes... This is heavily dependent
There's one modern event so massive that it toppled their entire culture and hierarchy
So, up to the event, they would work in tribes, but cooperatively. The tribes eventually became clans, and the clans eventually became companies
This happened over the course of millions of years, by the way

Artax:
Its a developed futurist society that developed into a buisness run government then? That then came crumbling down around them?

Skahdi:
Sort of
Not companies in the traditional sense
They do commerce, yes. But a company is basically a city and its population, before they became an intergalactic species, and companies expanded from cities to planets, until they owned billions of them
There's no government government

Footnote on evolution:
So they evolved on a cold planet orbiting a brown dwarf. The planet consists mostly of cave systems, and the surface is barren, with extremely strong winds. Since plants don't really photosynthesize, they mostly grow from the corpses of the animals that died in the caves. For that reason, all the plant life below the surface are made up of fungal cells, not plant cells. The plants adapted fine hairs, and the mitochondrion of the cells have adapted Photobacterium to mimic the eyes of predators to ward off other predators, which means they have spots that emit light and react to vibrations in the close surroundings... Long story short, the species evolved eyes to be able to see those plants, since they're omnivores. When the species became more civilized, they started harvesting those plants to create proper light sources and ink for writing and drawing their history on the cave walls
