That then came crumbling down around them? Skahdi: Sort of Not companies in the traditional sense They do commerce, yes. But a company is basically a city and its population, before they became an intergalactic species, and companies expanded from cities to planets, until they owned billions of them There's no government government Footnote on evolution: So they evolved on a cold planet orbiting a brown dwarf. The planet consists mostly of cave systems, and the surface is barren, with extremely strong winds. Since plants don't really photosynthesize, they mostly grow from the corpses of the animals that died in the caves. For that reason, all the plant life below the surface are made up of fungal cells, not plant cells. The plants adapted fine hairs, and the mitochondrion of the cells have adapted Photobacterium to mimic the eyes of predators to ward off other predators, which means they have spots that emit light and react to vibrations in the close surroundings...
